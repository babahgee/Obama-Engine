# Intro
A ``RenderObject`` is basically a parent class of a object that will be rendered in the canvas renderer. You can see it as a ``Empty GameObject``. You can't do much with it, its just to handle objects efficient.

# Methods
There is one static method wich is ``GetObjectInRenderer(renerer, objectID)`` which will return a existing RenderObject.
